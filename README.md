# **To Do List App** #

This is a simple to-do list app that allows its users to keep track of tasks they need to complete at any given moment. 

## Usage ##

* To create a task, you simply type it up in the field below and press the shiny green button when you want to add it to your to-do list:

Once your task has been added, your screen should look like this:

* If you are feeling unsure about the task you just created, you have the option to delete or edit it. Using the buttons on the right-hand side of the task:

* However, if that's not the case and you are satisified with the task and have completed it, your next step is to check it off using the checkbox on the left-hand side of the task:

* Lastly, you are also able to change the screen display from "dark mode" to "light mode" and vice-versa! Depending on how your eyes feel, using the toggle button on the top right-hand side of the screen:
